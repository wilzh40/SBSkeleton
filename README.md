##What is SBSkeleton?

SB Skeleton is a simple barebones template for cocos2d v3.1 and SpriteBuilder, containing the skeleton to make a simple game. The scenes are in a landscape orientation, but everything is easily changeable. 

###Why?

After while I got tired of doing the same tedious tasks: connecting different game scenes to buttons and reinventing the wheel by implementing high scores, volume, and all the basics of a game. Thus I decided to have a starting point template for all my games. 

##What does SBSkeleton contain?

It contains 5 scenes, all self-explanatory: 
- MainScene
- GameScene
- GameOverScene
- OptionScene
- CreditsScene
... and a Singleton

It contains various options in OptionScene:
- BGVolume
- FXVolume
- Reset High Score


##Roadmap
SBSkeleton is still a work in progress, and there are various flaws
I hope to fix, later on:
- Improper accelerometer calibration
- Bad programming syntax/conventions
- Lack of comments
